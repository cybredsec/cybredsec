## 🧠 About

CybredSec is a personal cybersecurity workspace focused on **real-world offensive security**,
hands-on labs, and attacker-oriented system analysis.

The work published here prioritizes **practical exploitation paths**, deep understanding of system internals,
and secure design derived from how systems actually fail — not theory, not copy-paste, not CTF noise.

## 🎯 Core Focus

### 📱 Mobile Security
- Android internals & application exploitation
- IPC, sandboxing & privilege boundaries
- Rooted devices & emulator-based analysis

### 🌐 Web & API Security
- OWASP Top 10 in real systems
- Authentication & authorization flaws
- Business logic & API abuse scenarios

### 🛠️ Reverse Engineering
- Static & dynamic analysis
- Binary and application behavior research
- Tool-assisted and manual workflows

### 🔴 Red Team Methodology
- Attack surface mapping
- Threat modeling
- End-to-end exploitation chains

## 🚀 Featured Work

### 🔐 CybredSec Learning Platform
A structured offensive security platform built around **real-world attack scenarios**.

- Progressive labs (beginner → advanced)
- Attacker-first mindset
- Emphasis on *why* vulnerabilities exist, not just how to exploit them
