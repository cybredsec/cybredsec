## 🧠 About

CybredSec is my personal cybersecurity workspace, focused on **real-world offensive security**,  
hands-on labs, and attacker-minded system analysis.

This profile showcases:
- Practical security projects
- Learning labs built from real attack paths
- Research-driven experimentation, not theory

No copy-paste. No CTF fluff.
